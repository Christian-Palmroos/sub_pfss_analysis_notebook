# sub_pfss_analysis_notebook

Includes the library of functions and the jupyter notebook for finding photospheric magnetic footpoints connected to a point in the interplanetary space.

Upcoming patch will bring the option to trace field lines in the other direction; up from the photosphere rather than down from the source surface.
